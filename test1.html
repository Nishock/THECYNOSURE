            <h3>observatry Team</h3>
            <p>Motive-   Aim  is to make a telescope so that we can see the astronomical unit with our own eye if it is really what we see on videos and pictures.<br> 

                Vision- To see the beautiful world  which we can't see from our naked eye.</p>

            <h3>Science porium</h3>
            <p>In the rapid moving world, now there is a need of robot such as"Human Following Robot" that can interact and co-exit with them. In this robot we have use arduino uno, DC motors, ultrasonic sensor, IR sensor  and for giving command we use C/C++ programming languages. Our system consist of four wheel robotic vehicle mounted with a separate microprocessor and control unit along with different sensor which help them to move. IR sensor controls the movement of sensor detect the obstacles and stops the motor. And their is a need of such robot that can assist humans and can serve them.</p>

            <h3>Teach learner</h3>
            <p>Motive-   Home automation or domestics 
                is building automation for home,called a smart home or smart house.A home automation system will monitor or control home attributes such as lighting,climate, entertainment system, home security such as acess control to do this things .<br>
                
                
                Vision-  the best home automation experience to everyone by combining the latest technology with style and elegance,Ideas, style, and simplicity .The main vision of this system is to control the home appliances and electronic devices with the help of a supervisory system. The supervisory system is designed in such a way that everyone can access it.</p>

            <h3>Class maneging system</h3>
            <p>Motive-. It is a project based on GUI based application which is based on python and MySQL .The aim of this project is to make a user friendly database to store information  of students  and show thse details when required.
                To make it secure ,it consists of admin login page which will ask for a specific user id and password .To make it move and secure the day is stored in binary file to in make it inaccessible  without the help of the application.<br>
                
                
                Vision- with it compactness, it would be in high demand in future.</p>

            <h3>O.V.O</h3>
            <p>It is a talking robot that can converse and hove ans to your questions

                Motive - is to learn and develop a full fleged robot that can talk, navigate and can be used on various place in our college</p>

            <h3>Distinguisher</h3>
            <p>Nowaday's road accidents is major problem all over the world . As report by WHO in its first global status report 80,000 of Indian people are killed on roads due to over speeding, drunk driving and drowsiness.
                The driver lost his control when he/she is about to sleep . The project can generate a model that can prevent such accidents. In this model the eye blink sensor is placed near the eyes on goggle to sense the blink time of eyes.
                Highways accidents are very prevalent and our design would be help to this problem by monitoring the eyelid movement of driver . Using a sensor to compare an open eye to a closed eye for a prolonged period will be the basis of our project .</p>

            <p> Robo G5 Car ( Robotic Car ) 
                -- It is a self driving car also called an Autonomous car
             It is a car incorporating vehicular automation, that is , a ground vehicle that is capable of sensing it's environment and moving safely with little. 
             It is a computer-controlled car that drives itself. <br>
             
             
             Benefits of Robotic car
                -- 1. 90℅ reduction in traffic deaths. 
                    2. They are lighter and they reduce the fuel consumption. 
                    3. Reduce air pollution.
